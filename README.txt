This directory is the final project for Math 241 at Reed College. 

This project explores Academy Award nominations and wins. For the project, I scraped and cleaned a great deal of data downloaded from numerous Wikipedia pages. Visualizations and analyses allow me to draw some conclusions about how prestige operates within the film industry. Lastly, I created a simple shiny app that allows users to explore some of the data I collected. 



The project folder contains the following key files:
